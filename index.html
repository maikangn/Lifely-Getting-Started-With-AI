      <p><span>AI Design Sprint </span>
       <span> /eɪ-aɪ dɪˈzaɪn sprɪnt/</span>
      <span>An AI Design Sprint is a time-constrained process executed by an interdisciplinary team. The process 
        focuses on proving the practical applicability of artificial intelligence models within an organisation. 
        The result is a prototype that automates parts of a business process, including a reflection on how a business will be able to work with AI in the future.</span></p>
